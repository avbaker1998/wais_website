Project: WAIS Website
Author: Allessandra Baker

In this project I used the Gatsby framework to create my react based web app.
The purpose of creating this project is to have a website for the WAIS club here at BYU.
I wanted a place for women to look, find pictures, see upcoming events,
learn more about WAIS, and find resources that are needed to learn.

I had to narrow down my scope and I wasnt able to include the upcoming events and the gallery page.
But considering the fact that I started out barely understanding react to building a full interactive react app
I feel quite accomplished with my project! I am very proud of how it turned out.
There was a lot of learning to it but I feel comfortable creating react apps that I could do it again in the future.

My hope is that I can continue to have this deployed for a while and hopefully pass it on to the next WAIS president.
I want to work on adding a logo, more quotes, the calendar/upcoming events page, and a gallery page of past events.
I want to turn this website into my summer project to make it better and more useful!

It was a fantastic project and I loved working on it.
